[Notes on ERC-20](https://learn.bybit.com/crypto/what-are-erc-20-tokens-and-erc-20-standard/)

**The ERC-20 refers to (Ethereum Request For Comments) while the number 20 represents the unique number ID to distinguish the standard from others. ERC-tokens are digital assets designed, issued, and used just like a Bitcoin, except it runs solely on the Ethereum blockchain**. **These tokens mainly rely on a specific [smart contract](https://learn.bybit.com/blockchain/what-are-smart-contracts-in-blockchain-how-it-works/) that keeps track of that token’s transactions.**

ERC-20 is a set of rules that help developers simplify and improve the process of creating a standard Ethereum-based token.
So, when you’re exchanging USDT or DAI, the chances of you being exposed to the concept of ERC or ERC-20 tokens are inevitable.

ERC-20 token standard paved a strategic pathway for creating new tokens
When analyzing cryptocurrencies from the blockchain perspective, new tokens have always struggled to interact with each other. Hence, Ethereum set a standard for every new token built on Ethereum to abide by the rules (ERC standard’s protocol.) From there, a new coin is must submit comprehensive information to the **[Ethereum Improvement Proposal](https://learn.bybit.com/glossary/ethereum-improvement-proposal/)Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) are documents with proposed features and processes that proffer potential changes ...** (EIP). These standard ERC-20 parameters include its name, **symbol** (an abbreviation used when displaying balances), **decimals** (determines the number of decimal places after the point), and the **total supply** of issued tokens.

## **The Difference Between Standard Crypto and ERC-20 Tokens**
First of all, [cryptocurrency is a form of digital assets](https://learn.bybit.com/crypto/what-is-cryptocurrency/) where they are encrypted by cryptography. That means these cryptos are running on their distinct blockchains, and the ledgers are distributed on decentralized blockchains.

Tokens, on the other hand, are a utility that exists on top of a blockchain. Ethereum’s ERC-20 tokens and some other alternatives, including the ERC-223, ERC-721 are among the most popular.
